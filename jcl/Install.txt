JEDI INSTALLER
==============

Helps you to integrate JCL with Delphi/BCB IDE. Currently it assists with:

- Compiling library units (release and debug versions)
- Compiling packages and installing design-time packages to the IDE
- Adding sample JCL Debug extension dialogs to Object Repository
- Adding JCL directories to Library Path / Browsing Path in Environment Options
- Adding JCL debug .dcu directory to Debug DCU Path in Debugger Options
- Integrating JCL help file to the IDE.
- in undoing above changes to the IDE settings ("Uninstall", new in 1.94 final).

To execute for

1) Win32
- click on "Install.bat" file in the JCL root directory.

  Note:	If you have Delphi 8 for Microsoft .NET installed, you probably will have 
	to specify the root directory of the make.exe to use for JCL installation; 
        on the commandline, type (for example):

	>install "C:\Program Files\Borland\Delphi5"

2) Kylix 3
- open a shell window
- cd into JCL root directory
- at the command prompt, type "sh ./install.sh", then press "Enter".
  You'll also need to do a "source kylixpath" first (see the README of your 
  Kylix 3 installation) in case your system is not set up to do that at startup.
