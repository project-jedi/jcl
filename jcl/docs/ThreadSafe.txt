Thread safe support

Some pieces of code can handle read/write accesses from multiples threads
without writing specific code.
This support can be enabled:
- by defining the THREADSAFE compiler symbol {$DEFINE THREADSAFE} when JCL
  units are part of a project.
- by checking the “Enable thread safe code” node in the installer options

Presently only the following units have some pieces of code that implicitly
handles thread safe accesses:
source\common\JclAbstractContainers.pas
source\common\JclArrayLists.pas
source\common\JclArraySets.pas
source\common\JclBinaryTrees.pas
source\common\JclHashMaps.pas
source\common\JclLinkedLists.pas
source\common\JclQueues.pas
source\common\JclStacks.pas

This support is made using critical sections, if you want other piece of code
to be thread safe, please create a feature request in the “Code Library” category
of the mantiss at http://homepages.borland.com/jedi/issuetracker/
